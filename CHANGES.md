# SQLAlchemy-JSONAPI Changelog

## 3.0.0

*2015-09-20*

* BREAKING: Implements #8 where `__jsonapi_type__` is replaced with `__jsonapi_type_override__`.  This can break previous configurations where `__jsonapi_type__` was used to override the generated type.  To fix breaks, just change it to `__jsonapi_type_override__` and it should work better.  Thank you, @angelosarto for your contribution on this.
