# sqlalchemy-jsonapi

[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) implementation for use with [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

**CRITICAL: This version is in complete redevelopment to include 1.0 compatibility, permission checks, custom descriptors, etc.  Do not use in production unless you have a masochistic side.**
